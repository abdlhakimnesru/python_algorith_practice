💪 Question 17: Find the Maximum Number in a List
# Write a Python function that:
# Takes a list of numbers as input.
# Returns the largest number in the list.
# ✅ Requirements:
# Use a for loop to find the maximum manually (don’t use max() yet).
# If the list is empty, return "empty list".
# Check that the input is a list.
